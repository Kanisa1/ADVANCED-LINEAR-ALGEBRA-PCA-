#Fuel Economy Dataset

Overview

This dataset contains standardized and normalized values of various vehicle attributes related to fuel economy, emissions, and performance. The dataset consists of 3,929 records with 14 features.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each vehicle entry (standardized).

year: Model year of the vehicle (normalized).

cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine (normalized).

displ: Engine displacement in liters (normalized).

pv2: Power-to-weight ratio (normalized).

pv4: Another power-related variable (normalized).

city: City fuel economy in miles per gallon (MPG) (normalized).

UCity: Urban fuel economy (normalized).

highway: Highway fuel economy in MPG (normalized).

UHighway: Urban highway fuel economy (normalized).

comb: Combined fuel economy (normalized).

co2: CO2 emissions in grams per mile (normalized).

feScore: Fuel economy score based on efficiency (normalized).

ghgScore: Greenhouse gas emissions score (normalized).

Data Preprocessing

The dataset has been standardized using normalization techniques, meaning that all numerical values are represented in a standardized range (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). Non-numeric categorical variables were excluded or transformed before processing.

Usage

This dataset can be used for:

Analyzing fuel economy trends

Predicting vehicle emissions and efficiency scores

Machine learning modeling for fuel efficiency optimization
